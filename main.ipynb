    "# Midterm Economic Modeling and Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Important: the midterm is different from the sample in significant ways, so if you just copy-paste the code your solutions will be most likely wrong and your grade will be penalized. If I detect errors that show that you have __copied from another classmate, your grade will me penalized__ even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The maximum score is 100 points, and you can get an additional 15 pts if your code is __particulary clean and original__; in other words, you can score less than 100 point in the exercises and still get a 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This exam is __open-book__: you may also lookup on the internet as long as you do not communicate with your classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total amount of points is 100, but you can get up to 15 bonus points if your code is clean and/or elegant. In other words, you do not need to get everything right to get the maximum grade. However, it is __critical that the code runs__ and that there are no execution errors: a code that runs but that misses some calculations will be graded benevolently; a code that does not run will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The midterm involves quite a lot of __plotting__; I have used the library `matplotlib.pyplot` extensively in the sample midterm because I find it easier for you to apply to time series, compared to `seaborn`. However, you are of course free to use `seaborn` if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the exercises below you will need the following libraries, parameters, and code to create the path for the plots:\n",

    "## Exercise 1: exploratory analysis and OLS [40 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) [5 pts] Load the dataset `diamonds` from `seaborn`. Print it and print the name of its columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) [5 pts] Create a new column called `volume` that is equal to the product of the dimensions `x`, `y` and `z` of the diamonds\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) [5 pts] Plot a histogram with the distribution of the `price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) [5 pts] Define a `LeastSquares` function like the one we defined in class, that provides the intercept and slope after getting as arguments an `x` and `y` vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) [5 pts] Apply the function to `carat` and `price`, in order to understand if there is a correlation between the carat of a diamond and its price. \n",
    "\n",
    "(f) [5 pts] Build a column called `fit_carat` that contains the model fit for `price` for the datapoints in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) [10 pts] Draw a scatterplot that includes `price` in the `y` axis, and `carat` in the `x` axis; plot both the actual dataset and your fits; for the fits, you do not need to use lines, you can use squared markers for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: logistic regression with statsmodels [25 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) [5 pts] Load the `mpg` dataset from `seaborn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) [5 pts] Create a new column called `usa` that is equal to `1` when the car has been manufactured in the US and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) [5 pts] With `statsmodels`, build a logistic regression model that takes the weight and the number of cylinders of the car as regressors and predicts whether a car was likely to be have been manufactured in the US (versus in the rest of the world). Get the summary of the results of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) [5 pts] Build a dataframe that contains data for a hypothetical car that weights 3000 units and has 4 cylinders.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) [5 pts] Predict the chances that this car has been manufactured in the US (versus in the rest of the world).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: time series [35 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) [5 pts] Read the file `daily-min-temperatures.csv`, which is in the `lesson/assets` folder. Specify the separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) [5 pts] Transform the column with the date into date format with the `to_datetime` command from `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) [5 pts] Sort the values of the dataframe by date, and apply a filter to get only the datapoints with dates after \"1982-01-01\" and before \"1989-12-31\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) [5 pts] Create a copy of the dataframe and apply an exponential smoothing with span equal to 30 to the column `temp`; you may overwrite the `temp` column or create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) [5 pts] Plot the original `temp` column against the exponentially smoothed one, in different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) [5 pts] Create a copy of the dataframe and apply a rolling moving average smoothing with span equal to 30 to the column `temp`; you may overwrite the `temp` column or create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) [5 pts] Plot the original `temp` column against the rolling moving average one, in different colors."

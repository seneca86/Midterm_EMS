# Midterm Economic Modelling and Simulation
## Instructions
* Choose one and only one option
* Fill out the answers sheet: that and only that sheet will be graded
* You will need to return the question sheet, but whatever you write on it will be disregarded
* All questions are worth the same
* Correct answers are worth +1
* Wrong answers are worth -1
* If you are unsure about an answer, leave it blank and it will be worth zero


1. How would you measure the accuracy of a classification problem (e.g. diagnosing a disease) when using logistic regression?

- a) Dividing the true positives by the true negatives
- b) Dividing the true positives by the false positives
- c) Dividing the sum of the true positives and the true negatives by the total 
- d) Dividing the sum of the false positives and the true negatives by the sum of the true negatives 

2. Choose the right import statement of the ‘car_crashes’ dataset from the `seaborn` package:
- a) ```
  import seaborn as sns
  df = sns.load_dataset('car_crashes')
  ```
- b) ```
 from seaborn import car_crashes
 ```
- c) ```
 import seaborn as pd
 car_crashes = sns.get_dataset_names('pandas')
```
- d)
```import diamonds from seaborn```

We will now work with a dataset called `diamonds`. It contains properties of diamonds such as the `depth`, the `price`, the `color`, etc. of a collection of diamonds.

3. In order to get the column names of the ‘diamonds’ dataset, the proper command is:

- a) `diamonds.columns`
- b) `diamonds.names`
- c) `diamonds.values`
- d) `diamonds[columns]`

Below you can find a sample of the `diamonds` dataset:
